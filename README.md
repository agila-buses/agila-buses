# My profile
I don't use this profile for much, but I might make the small contribution from time to time.

## Skills
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) - Started learning it when I was a child, and I have advanced knowledge of it.
Nowadays, I don't use it that much, however I do sometimes remix projects made by other people.
* Python - Have basic knowledge of the language, but I am currently not learning it.
* HTML/CSS - Intermediate knowledge - I have created a few websites, some of which can be found on here.
* Javascript - Basic knowledge - I learned some of the syntax, but then I lost motivation to continue learning the language.
